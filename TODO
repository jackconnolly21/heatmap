Make Heatmap Functionality better:
--> Marty - play with heatmap options (figure out how the package works better)
--> Marty - line/heatmap option (heatmap package being imported weirdly, currently disabled)
--> heatmap.html not showing actual image? (I think this might be fine now)
--> Move output folder to 'data' folder (currently in static, doesn't make sense)

Form Options:
--> option to do multiple uploads at a time
      (modify current upload page, click button to allow selection of another file,
      somehow allow a whole folder maybe?)
--> custom attack codes (add to db on user specific basis, map to current code)
--> save inputted info in *register*/login if something goes wrong (not super important)

Make Typeahead Work:
--> get javascript in index.html included (not finding js/possibly just alert function not working)

Style Issues:
--> adding active class in a better way (bootstrap 4?)/ different style (currently adding w/ js on each page)
--> convert to bootstrap 4? (currently messes a bunch of stuff up, probably not necessary)

Testing:
--> write some tests (use testdata, make some heatmaps, unit test parser and heatmap)

Database:
--> Marty - fix db url issue (use heroku CLI to fetch db URL)
--> try to move db code into db/ folder (not super important, just organization)

allow download option after generating heatmap
