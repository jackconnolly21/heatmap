Make Heatmap Functionality better:
--> Marty - play with heatmap options
--> Marty - line/heatmap option
--> heatmap.html not showing actual image? (I think this might be fine)

Form Options:
--> option to do multiple uploads at a time?
--> custom attack codes
--> save inputted info in *register*/login if something goes wrong

Make Typeahead Work:
--> get javascript in index.html included

Style Issues:
--> add active class to appropriate navbar item
--> convert to bootstrap 4?

Testing:
--> write some tests

Database:
--> fix db url issue

allow download option after generating heatmap
